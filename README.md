# PumpIt: Decentralized Meme Token Platform

## Overview

PumpIt is a fully decentralized platform designed for users to create, trade, and manage meme tokens. The platform leverages the power of smart contracts to provide a secure, trustless, and transparent environment for token creation and exchange.
PumpIt includes features for locking tokens and managing social interactions around tokens.

## Features

### 1. Token Creation and Swap

The core functionality of PumpIt revolves around the creation and exchange of ERC20 tokens, users can create new tokens and participate in swaps between ETH and these tokens.
The swap mechanism is designed to adjust rates dynamically, similar to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap.

#### Token Creation

- Users can create new ERC20 tokens.
- The newly created tokens are minted to a swap contract.
- The creator makes the first ETH to token swap.

#### Token Swap

- **ETH to Token**: Users can swap ETH for tokens. The rate adjusts based on the reserve ratios.
- **Token to ETH**: Users can swap tokens for ETH. The rate adjusts similarly.
- Swapping stops once the contract's ETH balance reaches a specified limit (30 ETH), triggering an upgrade process.

### Market Upgrade

- When the liauidity threshold is reached, the contract move the liquidity to the fraxswap pool and burn the claiming tokens.

### 2. Token Vault

PumpIt includes a vault feature that allows users to lock their tokens for a specified period, this mechanism enhances the utility and security of the tokens by enabling the developers to provide a piece of mind for thier community.

#### Vault Features

- **Token Locking**: Users can lock a specified amount of tokens for a predetermined period.
- **Withdrawal**: After the lock period ends, the owner can withdraw the locked tokens.

### 3. Web3 Social Interaction

PumpIt incorporates social features that allow users to create and manage pages for their tokens. these pages support posts, comments, and likes, facilitating community interaction and engagement around the tokens and limit fake community engagement.

#### Social Features

- **Token Pages**: Each token can have a dedicated page for social interactions.
- **Posts and Comments**: Users can create posts and comments on token pages.
- **Likes**: Posts and comments can receive likes, fostering community engagement.

## Architecture

PumpIt is composed of several smart contracts that interact seamlessly to provide a cohesive platform experience:

1. **PumpItDeployer**: The main contract responsible for deploying other contracts and coordinating interactions.
2. **TokenSwap**: Handles the creation of tokens and facilitates swaps between ETH and tokens.
3. **Vault**: Manages the locking and release of tokens based on specified periods.
4. **Web3Social**: Manages social interactions, including posts, comments, and likes related to tokens.

## How It Works

1. **Deploying Contracts**: The PumpItDeployer contract can create instances of TokenSwap, Vault, and Web3Social contracts.
2. **Creating Tokens**: Users can create new tokens through the TokenSwap contract, which mints the tokens to the swap contract and allows initial and subsequent swaps.
3. **Swapping Tokens**: The TokenSwap contract enables dynamic swapping between ETH and tokens, adjusting rates based on reserve balances.
4. **Locking Tokens**: Users can lock their tokens in a Vault contract for a specified duration, enhancing security and utility.
5. **Social Engagement**: Users can create and interact with posts, comments, and likes on token pages through the Web3Social contract.

## Conclusion

PumpIt offers a comprehensive and fully decentralized platform for creating, trading, and managing meme tokens. By integrating token swaps, vaults, and social interactions, PumpIt aims to foster a vibrant and engaged community around meme tokens. The platform's smart contracts ensure transparency, security, and trustlessness, aligning with the principles of decentralization and open-source development.
